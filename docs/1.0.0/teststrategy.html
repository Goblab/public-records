<h1>Testing Strategy for Public Records Request Management System</h1>
<p>
Conducted by Cris Cristina, Richa Agarwal, and Sheila Dugan, Oakland 2013 Code for America fellows
</p>
<p>
Last updated July 16, 2013
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
In its application to Code for America (CfA), the City of Oakland indicated it would like to utilize technology to better respond to public records requests. Occupy Oakland and other events that attracted scrutiny of the public revealed the system to be broken and strained the relationship between the city and the community.  
</p>
City staff found the software used to respond and track requests to be difficult to use.  Many request remained untracked.  The failure to track all requests meant city employees would waste time fulfilling many of the same requests. The City could not even track its progress by identifying the number of requests processed each year, the departments that receive the most requests, and how long it takes to fulfill a requests. 
</p>
<p>
We also learned average citizens do not know how to structure their requests.  This may lead them to submit broad requests the City is unable to fulfill or send them to the wrong department.
</p>
<p>
We are designing a system to help the City manage its public records requests, as well as allow the general public review the requests Oakland receives and its response to those requests.
</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Test the assumptions that informed the creation of our web application to-date.
</li>
<li>
Determine whether the application’s features complement a City employees workflow. 
</li>
<li>
Get public records online and available to the community in a transparent fashion. 
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Participants</h2>
<p>
The first department that will test the web application is the City Clerk’s office. The City Clerk’s office is targeted because:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They receive a large number of public records requests. We would not have to spend a long time “waiting” for requests to be made.
</li>
<li>
Many of their records do not contain a tons of confidential information. It will make it easy for the documents to be made immediately available to public online. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Other City of Oakland departments will be added as quickly as possible. The Oakland Police Department will be added after it is determined how to treat the documents they distribute. 
</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>
The web application will not be tested by all departments simultaneously. This is to limit the amount of disruption city-wide. Many of the features remain untested. There is a possibility they will not work correctly or make a simple task more complex and time-consuming. Focusing on one department (and in turn a couple of city employees) will allow us to be able to quickly respond to any questions and/or concerns. 
</p>
<p>
A splash page will be added to the current form for submitting PRRs giving the general public the opportunity to use the new web application if they are asking for records and documents from the City Clerk’s office. 
</p>
<p>
You can view the splash page by visiting <a href="http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/CityAdministration/PublicRecordsRequest/index.htm">the City of Oakland's website.</a>
</p>
<p>
Individuals submitting public records requests often do not know which departments to contact for their needs. This is why the copy redirects them to the new web application based on the document they desire, rather than asking them to first identify the department they want to contact. 
</p>
<p>
As more departments are added, the CfA fellows and the Online Communications Manager will help route the public records requests to the proper departments. 
</p>
<p>
This strategy may change suddenly depending on the schedules of city staff and the response to the web application. 
</p>
<h2>Collecting Feedback</h2>
<p>
Feedback on the web application will be collected from city employees in the following ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Feedback form: A form will be embedded on the current web application allowing users to provide us with their feedback on the project and which features they need to fulfill a public records request.
</li>
<li>
“Live” recorded sessions: Observe city employees use the system in real-time.
One-on-one testing sessions with users of the system. 
</li>
<li>
Schedule another session with  Public Records Request (PRR) liaisons to  demo application and hear their thoughts.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
All feedback will be tracked using GitHub issues. You can visit the following webpage to view all of the bugs and feature requests to date: <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/public-records/issues?state=open">https://github.com/codeforamerica/public-records/issues?state=open </a></p>
<h2>Prioritizing Feature Requests and Bug Fixes</h2>
<p>
We will continue to add new features as the web application is being tested in the City of Oakland. At the same time, we are committed to responding to the requests and concerns of city employees while they use the app to respond to live requests. We developed a methodology to prioritize bug fixes and feature requests.

If so, is it technically feasible?

Despite this, they will probably still be able to complete the task successfully.
