<h1>Research on the City of Oakland's Public Records Request Process</h1>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>We, the 2013 Code for America fellows, spent the month of February living and working in the City of Oakland. Throughout the month, we interviewed and shadowed city employees. We learned it is difficult for city employees to communicate and collaborate with each other across departments. There is a contentious relationship between the city and community. The fact that most residents find it difficult to get information from the city further strains the relationship. Finally, there is no way for city employees to be innovative. Staff have no shortage of ideas, but often do not have the resources or support to bring them into fruition.</p>
<p>
  City staff members tasked with fulfilling records request vocalized frustration with the process. The current software system is difficult to use. Public Records Request (PRR) liaisons receive little training, and often feel as if they do not have the authority to compel other employees to pass along records in a timely manner. These problems makes it difficult for residents to get the documents and information they need from the city.</p>
<h2>How the City Handles Public Records Requests</h2>
<p>Throughout the month of February, we conducted research on the public records request process in the City of Oakland. Our goals were to understand how the system currently works, the type of software city employees use to fulfill requests, and determine how satisfied people inside and outside of City Hall are about the system. We interviewed individuals in a variety of ciy departments.
</p>
<p>
The Public Records Request Liaisons, who are responsible for fulfilling requests for their respective departments, explained how they fulfilled each request. We observed a redaction using Summation and Adobe reader. We attended the weekly public records request working group meetings. These meeting addressed the process currently used and way it needed to be improved. On February 28, 2013, the working group hosted a focus group with PRR liaisons across departments. Attendees discussed what needed to change about the current process, how requests are tracked by department, training, and the most common types of records requests received.
</p>
<p>The Open Government Coordinator demonstrated how to use the Oracle Imaging and Process Management software package used to manage public records requests. </p>
<p>We also spoke with members of the public. On February 13, 2013, we hosted a focus group with members of the community about PRR. The attendees shared their stories about requesting a record from the city and the ways they believed the process could be improved. We also interviewed people waiting in line at the police administration building who were trying to make a records request. </p>
<h2>Insights</h2>
<p>From our conversations with city staff and members of the public, we discovered:
</p>
<p>
Public Records Request (PRR) Liaisons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The PRR liaisons have not received the same training around fulfilling a request. In our focus group, we noticed all liaisons were not using the same tools. (Some redacted by hand, while others did their redactions in Adobe.)
</li>
<li>
The PRR liaison is responsible for delivering the record, even though they may not "own" the record. The "record owner" may not feel the same urgency when responding to requests.
</li>
<li>
It also must be noted that individual PRR liaisons occupy different spaces in the organizations. Liaisons who are managers have more authority than those who are administrative assistants. They may have an easier time getting a response from their colleagues.
</li>
<li>
PRR Liaisons are not explicitly seen as a customer service role, even though they often interact with the public. 
</li>
<li>
Redaction process for public records requests are onerous, confusing, and often redundant. This increases the potential for error and decreases response times. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>Records Management: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Coordinating a response to a public records request is difficult. Records are "owned" by different people and departments. For requests with larger scope, information may be with multiple people or departments. This increases the time it takes for a request to be fulfilled.
 </li>
 <li>
 Records are distributed throughout the city staff and departments, and sometimes are accessed by only specific gatekeepers. This makes it difficult to know about or find information or records for internal or external (public records request) use.
<li>
E-mail is deleted from the citys servers after 60 days. This poses a problem when fulfilling requests.
</li> 
</ul>
<p>Software System:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The current software system is difficult to use. This is a particular problem for liaisons who do not often fulfill requests in a year. They essentially have to re-learn the system each time they use it. 
</li>
<li>
The majority of public records requests remain untracked. They are not always entered in the system, and individuals in each department keeps their own records. This means that work may be duplicated as the same records are repeatedly released. Even more important, it is difficult for the city to discover which records are the most popular so they can actively release the information to the public. 
</li>
<li>
There is no one person in the Department of Information Technology responsible for the maintenance of the current system used to respond to records requests. 
</li>
<li>   
The Oakland Police Department (OPD) currently uses three different systems for managing public records requests. This requires dedicated staff to pull data from two different systems into a third to manage the entirety of the requests. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>Administrative Policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Internal policy surrounding public records are unclear. Staff members are unsure of how to respond to a request. The quality of the responses vary by department.
</li>
<li>
There is no clear agreement on what constitutes a request for a public record and what is merely a request for information.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Feedback from Oakland residents:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Oakland residents will sometimes leverage their personal connections to city staff instead of going through formal channels to submit a request. 
</li>
<li>
Average citizens do not know how to structure their requests. This may lead them to submit requests that are too broad, making it more difficult to fulfill. 
</li>
<li>
Community members are unable to locate the information about the city. This frustratesthe information-seeker. It eventually strains the relationship between the community member and city representative, who will speak to the requester. 
</li>
<li>
 When an individual makes a public records request there is no visibility into what happens behind the scenes. If their request is invalid, they may not understand why.
